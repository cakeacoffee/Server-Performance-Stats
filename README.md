# Server-Performance-Stats

Hello ðŸ‘‹ this is my solution to the Server Performance Stats project on `https://roadmap.sh/projects/server-stats`

## How to Run

1. Clone Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cakeacoffee/Server-Performance-Stats.git
```

2. Make Script Executable
```bash
chmod +x server-stats.sh
```

3. Run the script
```bash
./server-stats.sh
```

## About the Project
### Requirements
>You are required to write a script server-stats.sh that can analyse basic server performance stats. You should be able to run the script on any Linux server and it should give you the following stats:

- [X] Total CPU usage

- [X] Total memory usage (Free vs Used including percentage)

- [X] Total disk usage (Free vs Used including percentage)

- [X] Top 5 processes by CPU usage

- [X] Top 5 processes by memory usage

- [ ] Stretch goal: 
    - Feel free to optionally add more stats such as os version, uptime, load average, logged in users, failed login attempts etc.
