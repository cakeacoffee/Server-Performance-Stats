## About the Project
### Requirements
>You are required to write a script server-stats.sh that can analyse basic server performance stats. You should be able to run the script on any Linux server and it should give you the following stats:

- [ ] Total memory usage (Free vs Used including percentage)

- [ ] Total disk usage (Free vs Used including percentage)

- [ ] Top 5 processes by CPU usage

- [ ] Top 5 processes by memory usage

- [ ] Stretch goal: 
    - Feel free to optionally add more stats such as os version, uptime, load average, logged in users, failed login attempts etc.
